I am an Experience Designer that specialises in assessing the end-to-end, surface to core of a product, system or service. When designing, I place equal value on the customer experience and the business process to ensure the optimal outcome.

I engage in meaningful communication with users, using Design Thinking techniques to solve their challenges and problems. I am able to achieve this through my process of learning, synthesising, ideating, prototyping, testing and validating.
I endeavour to always test risky assumptions early, build empathy, journey map and consistently iterate on ideas while working collaboratively and bringing teams closer together.

As a result, I am able to:
 - Identify unique opportunities for innovation
 - Enable holistic and meaningful improvements 
 - Design differentiated customer experiences
 - Refine value propositions
 - Reduce business costs or time consumption
 - Segment and create personas of business customers
 - Run successful design workshops with meaningful outcomes.

I have carried out roles in service design, UX (user experience), customer research and digital coaching.
